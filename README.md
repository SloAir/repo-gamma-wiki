# SloAir - repo gamma
## PROJECT/REPO GOALS:
To make our own BNF language.
Check if the languge is corecltly inputed and tranform it to a GeoJson format for izris od Aircraft and Airports in Slovenia.
## Intended Use
The code is intended to be used in a project, where it will show every airplane in the Slovenian airspace. This code will show the aircraft and airport.
## Product Scope
This repository contains a scanner and parser for out custon BNF (Backus-Naur Form) language. The primary objective of this language is to transform an inputted string into GeoJSON format, facilitating the representation and manipulation of geographical data.
## Definitions and Acronyms:
- BNF: Backus-Naur Form, a notation used to describe the syntax of programming languages or other formal grammars.
- GeoJSON: A format for encoding geographical data structures based on the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
- Scanner: A component responsible for breaking down the inputted string into individual tokens or lexemes.
- Parser: A component that analyzes the tokens produced by the scanner according to the defined grammar rules, creating a parse tree or abstract syntax tree.
- GitHub: A web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It allows collaborative development and management of code repositories.
